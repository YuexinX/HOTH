It is another progestin-only injectable contraceptive and was introduced shortly before Depo-Provera in 1957. Norethisterone enanthate is also sold under the brand names Doryxas, Norigest, Nur-Isterate, Syngestal, and Unidepo. While it is not available in the United States, Noristerat is widely used in the United Kingdom, Latin America, Africa, and parts of Europe. Noristrat only provides pregnancy protection for about eight weeks.</p>
